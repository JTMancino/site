        <h2>This Website</h2>
        <p>I am actively developing this website, which is new as of February 2025. Expect updates on the horizon including new projects and community partners, enhanced structure and functionality, and a custom domain. To report bugs or make suggestions feel free to email me!</p>

        <h2>AM Receiver Build</h2>
        <p>I am looking into building a simple AM radio receiver. I think this will be fun to do and also help build my soldering muscle memory. I do not know yet if I will add any features beyond receiving and playing audio decoded from AM broadcasts. I'm certainly interested in the idea of making it my own, and though I will use some prefabricated components I will make the antenna myself.</p>

        <h2>Home Email Server</h2>
        <p>I am going to setup a home email server, likely on the same domain as I acquire to host this website in the long term. I do not have much experience in this area so I expect the research and implementation to take some time, but I am excited to dig into SMTP and understand how the modern email ecosystem works.</p>
