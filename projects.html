        <h2>The Nothing Paradox</h2>
        <p>The origin of the world is really interesting. Lots of arguments from theology to axiarxhism try to explain where "stuff" comes from, as the ancients said, nihilo nihil fit. Another paper I'm working on is an exploration of this, and in particular, the question of how and why something comes from nothing. To keep it very brief, I try to solve this by redefining "nothing" as the metaphysical priority state or the state which is characterized by being efficiently uncaused.</p>

        <h2>Historic and Platonic Socrates</h2>
        <p>I am working on a history of philosophy paper about the transition in Plato's dialogues between the early and middle corpus. Most scholars seem to agree on "Meno" as the critical point of the transition, but I argue there's enough evidence to consider "Phaedo" as a reasonable alternative. I might update this website with a papers page to post my writing in lieu of real publication.</p>

        <h2>This Website</h2>
        <p>I am actively developing this website, which is new as of February 2025. Expect updates on the horizon including new projects and community partners, enhanced structure and functionality, and a custom domain. To report bugs or make suggestions feel free to email me!</p>

        <h2>AM Receiver Build</h2>
        <p>I am looking into building a simple AM radio receiver. I think this will be fun to do and also help build my soldering muscle memory. I do not know yet if I will add any features beyond receiving and playing audio decoded from AM broadcasts. I'm certainly interested in the idea of making it my own, and though I will use some prefabricated components I will make the antenna myself.</p>

        <h2>Home Email Server</h2>
        <p>I am going to setup a home email server, likely on the same domain as I acquire to host this website in the long term. I do not have much experience in this area so I expect the research and implementation to take some time, but I am excited to dig into SMTP and understand how the modern email ecosystem works.</p>
